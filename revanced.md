1. Install [Revanced Manager](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases) and [Vanced MicroG](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases) and install both
2. Open Revanced Manager and allow installing unknown apps from it.
3. Go to the 'Patcher' tab and press on "Select an application"
4. Now press on YouTube
5. Now it should show two versions: "Current" and "Recommended", remember the version number from Recommended
6. Search the version number from Recommended on [Apkmirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/uploads/?appcategory=youtube)
7. Tap on the correct version. On the new page you should see a download category with two variants, choose the one with the "APK" tag (the one without the "Bundle" tag) and download it
8. Now return to the Revanced Manager, go to the Patcher tab, press "Select an application" and this time press the button in the bottom right corner labeled "Storage" and allow Revanced storage permissions
9. In the file chooser, select the downloaded YouTube apk
10. Now select the patches you want, just make sure to also apply the MicroG Support patch if your phone is not rooted. I recommend just using the "Recommended" button at the top.
11. Once you're done choosing all the patches you want applied, press the "Done" button in the lower right corner and after that the "Patch" button
12. Wait for the apk to be built, this will take a while. Once that is done press the install button at the bottom of the screen
